                If you've bought this zine or even if you're reading it from a friend, this truly means the world to me. I am thankful for Ben, for giving this project the visibility I feel it deserves. I personally don't enjoy putting myself out there through social media or anything of that sort, so this feels nice. It's intimate, and there's a mutual understanding that it's a platform for both Ben and I to express ourselves. 
                <br><br>   I'm writing this on the 30th of July, the day of the launch. I may update this small blog post section over time. Regardless if I do or not, I hope you thoroughly enjoyed this magazine. Issue02 will feature a lot of ideas that we didn't get to this time around. In particular, some involvement from all of you guys who bought this zine. I want to interview eveyone of you and ask your thoughts on specific spreads.
                <br><br> If you're interested message the @blythe.magazine instagram account and type some inane shit like "monkey". 
                <br><br> That's all for this post anyways, thanks guys. Stay safe!
