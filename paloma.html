<!-- It's #notallmen, until you have a daughter.
/r/all

Then suddenly you will be telling her, that she needs to be wary of strange men approaching her. You're gonna tell her to never get into a car with a strange man. When she grows older you will maybe feel a little uncomfortable when she wears revealing clothing to her night out. You will eventually want to meet her boyfriend, just to know that he has his head on straight.

Then all of a sudden, it is all men, because of course, you are a man and "you know how they can be sometimes".

But when women have been telling you all along, how we need to be wary of men you call us "feminazis" and "man-haters", because we have been harrassed, assaulted, beaten and murdered and we just want our peace. How hard is it to understand that we just want to be left alone? That we want to be able to live our days without this constant background fear? I hope you will understand someday. -->
