                Case 82, Denmark - 50m from object, witness paralyzed (also birds and cows). Four handsome men with brown skin emerge with translucent helmets. <br><br>

                Case 144, France - When Dewilde attempted to intercept two dwarfs, a strong orange light was emitted from object on rail tracks about 20' away. Lorenzen's account says light as powerful as a Mg flare from a square opening. Dewilde lost use of speech and legs until beam was switched off. <br><br>

                Case 147, France - Riding a bicycle, witness felt a prickling or itching sensation over whole body like electric shocks. On alighting, prickling continued as well as paralysis. Very small man then came and touched him on shoulder, then left in nearby craft, whereupon paralysis left. <br><br>

                Case 162, France - Craft 50m away; 3 figures emerge from the light as witness felt paralysed, then lost consciousness. <br><br>

                Case 165, France - Witness, already under partial hypnosis, approaches man in overalls and helmet, who is holding a metal rod and had a light projector on his chest. The man appeared suddenly at 30ft distance near a floating dome. Witness felt paralyzed along with 7 others. Man, and soon after, the craft as well, vanished. Paralysis leaves. Witness had insomnia, headaches, loss of appetite for about a week. <br><br>

                Case 171, France - Man and dog paralyzed as object dives towards them and climbs again. <br><br>

                Case 197, France - When near object, employees felt "pricklings and a sort of paralysis". Object flew off. <br><br>

                Case 208, France - Witness sees 8' diam. object and feels paralysed, also grasping for air. <br><br>

                Case 221, France - Riding bicycle, witness stopped as figure in diving suit with bright eyes and hairy chest aimed a double beam of light from two vertical headlights on front of suit, paralysed. <br><br>
